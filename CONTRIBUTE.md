# Contribute to Sigil

Contributions are very much welcome! If you want to hack with me live, you can find me
at the [Twin Cities Open-Source meetups](https://twincitiesos.dev/).

Please checkout the [Github Issues](). I do assign issues to people feel like they have a chance
to do the contribution before someone else beats them to it.

If you plan on working on something more complex, please join the [NatesCode Discord]().
